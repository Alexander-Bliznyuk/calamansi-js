<h1 class="h">Getting Started</h1>

<h2 class="h">Calamansi.js Files</h2>

<p>
    Copy the Calamansi.js files inside your project folder, which includes: <em>calamansi.css</em>, <em>calamansi.js</em> and the <em>skins</em> folder. Then ddd this into your <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> block:
</p>

<code>
&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/calamansi.css"&gt;

</code>

<p>
    ... and this right before <em>&lt;/body&gt;</em>:
</p>

<code>
&ltscript src="path/to/calamansi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

</code>

<!--  -->

<h2 class="h">Inline/In-Text Skins</h2>

<p>Simple in-text or inline skins are meant to be used within the text and can be used for things like adding pronunciation tracks to words. Naturally, these can only play single tracks.</p>

<p>To start, add the following HTML:</p>

<code>
&lt;span class="calamansi" data-skin="path/to/skins/in-text"
    data-source="path/to/track.mp3"&gt;Song Title or Whatever Text Here&lt;/span&gt;

</code>

<p>
    Provide the path to a specific skin folder inside the <em>data-skin</em> attribute and the path to an audio file inside the <em>data-source</em> attribute. You can put as many elements like this on the page as you want, with each element having the <em>calamansi</em> class. The text inside the <em>&lt;span&gt;</em> will not be removed and will be used inside the player instead (although, this might be not the case depending on the skin).
</p>

<p>
    Next, to initialize all the instances of the player at once add the following JavaScript:
</p>

<code>
&lt;script&gt;
    Calamansi.autoload();
&lt;/script&gt;

</code>

<!--  -->

<h2 class="h">Regular Skins</h2>

<p>
    Regular skins, which could be pretty complex, are block elements. These skins could be responsive to various degrees depending on the skin, so you should give each skin element a wrapper defining or restricting the size of the player. An example HTML would look like this:
</p>

<code>
&lt;div style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"&gt;
    &lt;div id="calamansi-player-1"&gt;
        Loading player...
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</code>

<p>
    Here we restrict the size of the player to 300x300 pixels using a wrapper div element. The player element itself doesn't have any data parameters. You can have as many of these as you want, but don't forget to use a unique <em>id</em> for each player. The <em>Loading player...</em> text is what your users will see until the player is loaded. Although, some skins might keep this text.
</p>

<p>
    Each instance of a player like this is initialized manually via JavaScript:
</p>

<code>
&lt;script&gt;
    new Calamansi(document.querySelector('#calamansi-player-1'), {
        skin: 'path/to/skins/skin-folder',
        playlists: {
            'Classics': [
                {
                    source: 'music/classics/Skrjabin Etude_Op8_No12.mp3',
                },
                {
                    source: 'music/classics/Double Violin Concerto - J.S. Bach.mp3',
                },
            ],
        }
        defaultAlbumCover: '/path/to/skins/default-album-cover.png',
    });
&lt;/script&gt;

</code>

<p>
    In this case you always have to specify an object of playlists even if you have a single track to play. Each playlist has a name and is an array of audio sources. Keep reading to learn about the options you could pass when initializing players in this manner.

                An object with playlists where each key is the name of the playlist. Each playlist is an array of tracks/audio sources. Besides the track source you can provide track info (although track info for mp3 files is read automatically from ID3 tags), including any number of custom fields. Bear in mind that the custom fields won't be displayed unless they are present in the skin itself.
