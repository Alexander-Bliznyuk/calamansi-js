<h2 class="h">Single Player Events</h2>

<p>
    You can add event listeners to each player instance:
</p>

<code>
var player = new Calamansi(document.querySelector('#player'), {
    skin: 'path/to/skins/skin-folder'
});

player.on('initialized', function (player) {
    //
});

</code>

<!--  -->

<p>
    You can also listen for events among all the player instances on the page. The collback function contains the player instance where the event has been triggered.
</p>

<code>
CalamansiEvents.on('initialized', function (player) {
    //
});
